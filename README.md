# DiabetesGuard

**DiabetesGuard** is a comprehensive solution for tracking and predicting the likelihood of diabetes. It combines a frontend, backend, and machine learning model to provide users with insights into their health and recommendations based on their risk level.

## Features

- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizes machine learning to predict diabetes risk based on user data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive frontend interface for easy interaction and data visualization.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensures user data is handled securely with proper validation and storage.

## Components

### Frontend

The frontend of the DiabetesGuard application is built using React. It provides a user-friendly interface for interaction with the prediction model and displays results based on user input.
